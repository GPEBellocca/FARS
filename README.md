# FARS - Factor-Augmented Regression Scenarios

The `fars` package provides a comprehensive framework in R for modeling and forecasting economic scenarios based on the multi-level dynamic factor model (MLDFM). The package enables users to:

- (i) Extract global and block-specific factors using a flexible multilevel factor structure.
- (ii) Compute asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings.
- (iii) Estimate factor-augmented quantile regressions.
- (iv) Recover full predictive densities from these quantile forecasts.
- (v) Estimate the density when the factors are stressed.
